# Lesson 7 - Scaling Your Team

---

## üìñ Project Overview
Welcome to **Lesson 7** of the TandemFlow AI Development Course. This lesson is where things accelerate significantly as we explore **advanced usage of Aider** for AI-assisted software development. You'll learn how to:
- Run **multiple instances** of Aider concurrently.
- Use **Aider programmatically** within Python projects.
- Optimize **Flask applications** for enhanced AI interaction.
- Implement a **structured Architect prompt** for better UI/UX.
- Automate prompt generation with AI.

## üìå Lesson Breakdown

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Setup & Environment**
- Clone the repository and set up your environment:
  ```sh
  git clone [repo-link]
  cd [project-folder]
  ```
- The repository is updated from Lesson 6 with **new prompts and files**.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Multi-Instance Aider Usage**
- **Using multiple instances of Aider simultaneously**.
- **Running Aider inside Python code**.
- The potential risks and benefits of **trusting AI to generate production-ready code**.
- **Best practices** to mitigate risks when using Aider.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Aider with a Flask Wikipedia Fetcher**
- The project includes a **Flask server** that fetches Wikipedia articles.
- **Alamo integration** is used to analyze articles.
- Steps to run the existing Flask app:
  ```sh
  python3 app.py
  ```
- **Key goal:** Enhance the application‚Äôs user experience without altering core functionality.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Improving the Frontend with Architect Prompts**
- The **Architect prompt** refines how AI interacts with the UI.
- Objectives:
  - Wikipedia text should be **editable within the page**.
  - No interference with **existing article fetching**.
  - **More intuitive and structured prompts**.
- **Refining AI-driven UI changes** without disrupting backend logic.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Aider Configuration for Maximum Automation**
- Adjust **Aider's configuration file** to maximize efficiency.
- **Enabling automatic confirmations (`yes_always = true`)** for faster iteration.
- **Trade-offs**: Increased speed vs. reduced oversight.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Custom Buttons for AI-Powered Text Analysis**
- Existing setup has **only one button** (Analyze Article).
- Goal: Allow users to **add custom buttons** to run different AI prompts.
- Steps to add a button:
  ```sh
  /ask "What files do I need to modify to add a button?"
  ```
- Iterating **button configurations dynamically** using Aider.

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Using Aider Programmatically in Python**
- Importing Aider into Python to automate AI interactions:
  ```python
  from aider import Coder
  coder = Coder(model='sonnet')
  coder.run("Generate a summary for this text")
  ```
- **Advantages** of embedding AI-driven agents directly into code.
- **Context management**: Read-only vs. editable files.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Improving and Automating AI Prompts**
- Using **Aider to improve Aider's own prompts**.
- Automating the generation of **structured, optimized prompts**.
- Example prompt refinement:
  ```sh
  /ask "Refactor this prompt to make it more structured and context-aware."
  ```
- AI-generated improvements ensure **consistent, efficient prompting**.

---

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Enhancing AI-Generated Buttons**
- Example new buttons:
  - **"Five Fun Facts"** - Extracts fun facts from text.
  - **"Key Figures"** - Identifies important people in an article.
- Refining button logic to ensure **accurate prompt passing**.
- **Iterating improvements** by leveraging Aider for debugging and refinement.

---

### **üîü Testing & Finalizing Features**
- Running the Flask app with newly added AI-enhanced buttons.
- **Debugging errors** using Aider-generated fixes.
- Ensuring proper **AI interactions for each button function**.

---

## üöÄ Key Takeaways
- **Multi-instance AI coding** accelerates development but requires careful management.
- **Programmatic AI integration** allows for dynamic, scalable AI features.
- **Pattern-driven development** improves efficiency in AI-assisted workflows.
- **Aider is a powerful development assistant**‚Äîbut always validate its outputs.

---

## üî• Next Steps
- **Lesson 8 Preview**:
  - **AI-driven evaluations** for generated content.
  - **Advanced prompt chaining** techniques.
  - **Optimizing multiple AI agents for large-scale development**.

**Action Item:** Experiment with programmatic AI buttons and enhance the project based on your needs!
