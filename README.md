# **Lesson 7: Scaling Your Team**

## **Overview**  
This lesson covers how to efficiently scale your workflow with Aider by running multiple instances, integrating it into Python projects, and enhancing an existing project (the Wiki Project) to make it more interactive and user-friendly.

## **1. Running Multiple Instances of Aider**  
### **Why Run Multiple Instances?**  
- Enables parallel task execution  
- Improves efficiency when working on different aspects of a project  
- Reduces waiting time by handling multiple requests at once  

### **Using Auto-Yes to Streamline Instances**  
- Automates confirmations, removing the need for manual approvals  
- Allows for a smoother and faster workflow  
- Example: Running multiple Aider instances without needing to approve each step manually

## **2. Using Aider in Python Code**  
### **Setting Up a Program to Create New Buttons and Prompts**  
- Automates user interactions with Aider  
- Enables customization of input and output for improved functionality  
- Example: Implementing buttons that generate different LLM responses dynamically

## **3. Demo: Improving the Wiki Project**  
### **Making the Project Visually More Appealing**  
- Design a prompt to enhance UI/UX  
- Modify the Wikipedia section to accept any text input  
  - Extend functionality beyond Wikipedia to summarize any given text  
- Implement scrollable text input to accommodate longer documents  

### **Enhancing the Summary Section**  
- Improve text formatting for better readability  
- Expand the LLMâ€™s capabilities beyond summarization  
  - Example: Extract key insights, generate action items, or provide alternative summary formats  

### **Programmatic Usage of Aider**  
- Use Python to introduce buttons and prompts dynamically  
- Modify existing files to support multiple LLM response types  
- Demonstration: Implementing and testing new interactive features
